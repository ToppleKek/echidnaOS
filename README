 echidnaOS
-----------

- What is echidnaOS?

echidnaOS is an attempt at creating an operating system from scratch.
The kernel is written primarily in C, with some assembly here and there.

 Building instructions
-----------------------

Please, follow these instructions to build a bootable IMG of echidnaOS.
You can then write the resulting image to a Hard Drive, a USB drive, or
even an SSD!

- Requirements:

nasm
gnu make
qemu (for testing the image, non essential)

!!!
Building the cross compiler requires an environment capable of building
GCC and Binutils. (usually the packages gcc, g++, make, and bison)
The "build-essential" package on Debian-like systems contains all
necessary dependencies.
!!!

- Step by step:

You can install all the above packages on Ubuntu/Debian with the following
commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nasm build-essential qemu-system-x86

Make sure you are in the root of the source tree.

Now let's build the cross toolchain:

    make tools32

This step will take a while, especially on slower systems.

Now that every requirement is satisfied, let's build the kernel and create
the image:

    make all

If make didn't error, congratulations, you managed to build echidnaOS.
There should be a bootable "echidna.img" image in the project's root now.

You can test the image in qemu with:

    qemu-system-i386 echidna.img
