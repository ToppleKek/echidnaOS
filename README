 echidnaOS
-----------

- What is echidnaOS?

echidnaOS is an attempt at creating an operating system from scratch.
The kernel is written primarily in C, with some assembly here and there.

 Building instructions
-----------------------

Please, follow these instructions to build a bootable image of echidnaOS.

- Requirements:

nasm
gcc (a cross compiler would be ideal)
gnu make
git

- Step by step:

After making sure that you have the aforementioned packages installed,
proceed by cloning the echidnaOS repo:

    git clone https://github.com/echidnaOS/echidnaOS.git
    cd echidnaOS

Now that we're in the root of the echidnaOS tree, we're still missing a
key component, the C library.
Let's fetch libc:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

The makefile by default will use "cc" as the C compiler, and "ld" as the
linker.
You might want to point make to the correct cross compiler instead.
To do that, open "makefile" with a text editor, and edit the first 2 lines
accordingly, using the full path of your cross compiler and linker.

Now that every requirement is satisfied, let's build the OS.
Make sure that you have root privileges, or run "make" with sudo:

    sudo make

If make didn't error, congratulations, you managed to build echidnaOS.
There should be a bootable "echidna.img" image in the project's root now.
