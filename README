 echidnaOS
-----------

- What is echidnaOS?

echidnaOS is an attempt at creating an operating system from scratch.
The kernel is written primarily in C, with some assembly here and there.

 Building instructions
-----------------------

Please, follow these instructions to build a bootable IMG of echidnaOS.
You can then write the resulting image to a Hard Drive, a USB drive, or
even an SSD!

- Requirements:

git
nasm
gcc cross-compiler (follow instructions to download it)
gnu make
qemu (for testing the image, non essential)

- Step by step:

You can install all the above packages on Ubuntu/Debian with the following
commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git nasm build-essential qemu

Proceed by cloning the echidnaOS repo:

    git clone https://github.com/xtcshd/echidnaOS.git
    cd echidnaOS

Now let's download and extract the GCC cross compiler:

Copy the extracted "gcc" folder to the root of the echidnaOS source tree.

Now that every requirement is satisfied, let's build the kernel and create
the image:

    sudo make all

If make didn't error, congratulations, you managed to build echidnaOS.
There should be a bootable "echidna.img" image in the project's root now.

You can test the image in qemu with:

    qemu-system-i386 echidna.img
