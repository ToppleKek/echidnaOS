 echidnaOS
-----------

- What is echidnaOS?

echidnaOS is an attempt at creating an operating system from scratch.
The kernel is written primarily in C, with some assembly here and there.

 Building instructions
-----------------------

Please, follow these instructions to build a bootable ISO of echidnaOS.

- Requirements:

git
nasm
gcc i686-elf cross-compiler (follow instructions to download it)
gnu make
grub-mkrescue (to build the ISO)
xorriso (to build the ISO)
qemu (for testing the image, non essential)
bochs (for testing the image, non essential)

- Step by step:

You can install all the above packages on Ubuntu/Debian with the following
commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git nasm build-essential
    sudo apt-get install grub-common xorriso qemu bochs bochs-x

Proceed by cloning the echidnaOS repo:

    git clone https://github.com/echidnaOS/echidnaOS.git
    cd echidnaOS

Now that we're in the root of the echidnaOS tree, we're still missing a
key component, the C library.
Let's fetch libc:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Now let's download and extract the GCC cross compiler:

Copy the extracted "gcc" folder to the root of the echidnaOS source tree.

Now that every requirement is satisfied, let's build the kernel and create
the ISO image:

    make
    make iso

If make didn't error, congratulations, you managed to build echidnaOS.
There should be a bootable "echidna.iso" image in the project's root now.

You can test the image in qemu with:

    make test-qemu-iso
